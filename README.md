TempReaderQT  Includes arduino code and  QT project so that you can see and use this to advantage 

Special Thanks to UTUBE presentations on this topic
Credit to Bryan Cairns  whom  inspired interest in many if us to take view QT in a very different light  

Knowledge that I  am pleased to have  so that I too can be of benefit to communities internationally  and show others how to  use  open source to the best of its advantage  with  now better prospects of work in other fields 

Thanks to you all
